  <h6>The Utility Of our Services</h6>

<div>
  <p class="ry_p">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first service we can give to a person who wants to settle in Canada is to tell him quickly if his chances of acceptance are good or weak. We know that as long as a person lives in the uncertainty of waiting for an answer, it temporarily suspends the normal course of his daily life because his future plans are uncertain.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">Better informing a person before they file an immigration file saves them from losing government fees and fees.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">Our initial report serves that purpose. If our analysis, supported by the 23 years of experience of a large specialized team, does not allow to find a means of immigration according to the criteria in force, it means that there is no possibility of immigration in under the laws and regulations.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">In such a case, the client is informed in writing in his report and we will not open a formal application procedure for his file even if the Applicant insists.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">It takes us 72 hours to submit our written report and the candidate will then be clearly set on his project.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">Obviously, in this case, it is useless to believe what we could say elsewhere because some firms promise without being able to bring the results after years of fees and procedures.</p>
  <p class="ry_p">Our experience allows us to be quick, clear and precise about the chances of a Candidate's immigration to both Quebec and the rest of Canada and that is what candidates are looking for to guide their future.</p>

  <p class="ry_p">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the study of the profile of the Candidate gives a positive conclusion, we will open his official request and we will guide him for each step until his acceptance and his arrival on the territory. This requires constant help and availability, as well as relevant information so that the time, effort and money invested in this life project will yield the desired results. The importance of our service is to avoid the loss of time, money and especially the disappointment of a refusal after a long delay.</p>
  
  <p class="ry_p">Of course, all the related and necessary procedures for the official immigration application are made by our teams, particularly for the comparative evaluation of diplomas. This is also an important peace of mind.</p>
  <br><br>

<div>
  <p class="ry_p">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish, once the visa is in hand, we offer a very advanced service of assistance on arrival so that the first months are constructive and useful because we believe that success in Canada is as important as there arrive.</p>
  
  <p class="ry_p">So, as soon as you arrive at the airport, a member of the ACCES CANADA family is waiting for you so that your first steps towards a successful immigration are accompanied.</p>

  ================================ <br>
  Like all companies that set a standard in a field, ACCES CANADA is much copied in its methods and approach by different competitors who appear and disappear according to the times. However, our longevity and our tens of thousands of satisfied customers are the references that should serve as a basis for your decision.
